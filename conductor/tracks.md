# Project Tracks

This file tracks all major tracks for the project. Each track has its own detailed plan in its respective folder.\n---\n\n## [x] Track: Implement the training pipeline including backpropagation, SGD optimizer, and dataset loading from WAV samples.\n*Link: [./conductor/tracks/training_pipeline_20260101/](./conductor/tracks/training_pipeline_20260101/)*
\n---\n\n## [ ] Track: Implement model persistence using a custom binary format to save and load trained weights and biases.\n*Link: [./conductor/tracks/model_persistence_20260101/](./conductor/tracks/model_persistence_20260101/)*
