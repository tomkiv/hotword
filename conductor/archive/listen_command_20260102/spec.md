# Specification: 'Listen' Command & Action Triggering\n\n## Overview\nThis track implements the primary user-facing feature: the ability to listen for a hotword in real-time and execute a predefined action upon detection. It integrates the audio capture, inference engine, and command execution into a single, cohesive CLI command.\n\n## Functional Requirements\n- **'listen' Subcommand:** Add a new `hotword listen` command to the CLI.\n- **Action Execution:** \n  - `--action <command>`: Execute a shell command string.\n  - `--script <path>`: Execute a specific script file.\n- **Visual Feedback:** \n  - Print a prominent "HOTWORD DETECTED!" message.\n  - Display a real-time detection counter.\n  - Log the detection timestamp and model confidence score.\n- **Cool-down Period:** Implement a configurable cool-down (default 2s) to prevent multiple triggers from a single hotword instance.\n- **Inference Integration:** Continuously pipe audio from `pkg/audio/capture` into `pkg/engine.Engine`.\n\n## Configuration Integration\n- Key config items: `detection_threshold`, `cooldown_ms`, `default_action`.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- Running `hotword listen --action "echo 'Hello'"` correctly detects the hotword from the microphone and prints "Hello".\n- The detection counter increments correctly for each unique detection.\n- The system remains responsive and does not double-trigger during the cool-down period.
