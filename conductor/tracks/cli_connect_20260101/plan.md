# Plan: Connect CLI to Implementation\n\n## Phase 1: Feature Extraction Utility\n- [x] Task: Create unified feature extraction package (f5de33b)\n  - [ ] Write tests for `pkg/features.Extract` (WAV to Mel-Spectrogram)\n  - [ ] Implement extraction pipeline in `pkg/features` using `pkg/audio`\n- [ ] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Phase 1: Feature Extraction Utility' (Protocol in workflow.md)\n\n## Phase 2: Train Command Integration\n- [ ] Task: Connect 'train' command to backend\n  - [ ] Update `cmd/train.go` to load dataset and initialize `pkg/train.Trainer`\n  - [ ] Implement the training loop execution and model saving\n  - [ ] Write integration tests for `hotword train` execution\n- [ ] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Phase 2: Train Command Integration' (Protocol in workflow.md)\n\n## Phase 3: Verify Command Integration\n- [ ] Task: Connect 'verify' command to backend\n  - [ ] Update `cmd/verify.go` to load model and dataset\n  - [ ] Implement inference loop using `pkg/engine.Engine`\n  - [ ] Add detailed accuracy and confusion matrix reporting\n  - [ ] Write integration tests for `hotword verify` execution\n- [ ] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Phase 3: Verify Command Integration' (Protocol in workflow.md)
