# Specification: Connect CLI to Implementation\n\n## Overview\nThis track bridges the gap between the professional Command-Line Interface (Cobra/Viper) and the core hotword detection, training, and model persistence implementations. It ensures that user commands actually trigger the underlying learning and inference logic.\n\n## Functional Requirements\n- **Feature Extraction Package:** Create a new `pkg/features` package that combines STFT and Mel-Filterbank logic into a single, unified pipeline.\n- **Train Command Connection:** \n  - Update `cmd/train.go` to use `pkg/train.Trainer` and `pkg/train.LoadDataset`.\n  - Ensure it extracts Mel-Spectrogram features from all samples before training.\n  - Save the resulting model binary using `pkg/model.SaveModel`.\n- **Verify Command Connection:**\n  - Update `cmd/verify.go` to use `pkg/model.LoadModel`.\n  - Load the verification dataset and perform end-to-end inference using `pkg/engine.Engine`.\n  - Report accuracy, confusion matrix (TP, TN, FP, FN), and list failed samples.\n\n## Configuration Integration\n- Parameters like `sample_rate`, `window_size`, `num_mel_filters`, `epochs`, and `learning_rate` must be read from Viper, allowing overrides via `config.yaml` or flags.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- Running `hotword train --data ./my_data` successfully trains a model and saves a binary.\n- Running `hotword verify --model model.bin --data ./test_data` outputs a clear accuracy report and confusion matrix.\n- Verification results match those produced by previous manual verification scripts.
