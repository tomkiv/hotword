# Plan: Individual WAV Verification (predict)\n\n## Phase 1: Subcommand Scaffolding [checkpoint: 9647ba9]\n- [~] Task: Create 'predict' command in `cmd/predict.go`\n  - [ ] Implement flag parsing for `--file`, `--model`, and `--threshold`\n  - [ ] Add Cobra/Viper binding for new flags\n  - [ ] Write unit tests for `predict` command scaffolding in `cmd/predict_test.go`\n- [x] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Phase 1: Subcommand Scaffolding' (Protocol in workflow.md) (9647ba9)\n\n## Phase 2: Implementation and Inference\n- [~] Task: Implement file prediction logic\n  - [ ] Load WAV file and normalize to 1 second (16,000 samples)\n  - [ ] Integrate `pkg/features.Extract` and `pkg/engine.Engine`\n  - [ ] Implement result reporting (verdict, confidence, metadata)\n- [x] Task: Write integration tests for hotword predict (42f9c6b)\n  - [ ] Create tests in `cmd/predict_integration_test.go` using dummy WAVs\n- [ ] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Phase 2: Implementation and Inference' (Protocol in workflow.md)
