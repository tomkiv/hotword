# Specification: Individual WAV Verification (predict)\n\n## Overview\nThis track adds a new CLI subcommand, `predict`, which allows users to test the trained hotword model against a single WAV file. It provides a quick way to get a "verdict" and confidence score for any audio sample without running a full verification suite.\n\n## Functional Requirements\n- **'predict' Subcommand:** Add `hotword predict --file <path> --model <path>` to the CLI.\n- **WAV Processing:** \n  - Load and normalize the WAV file following the same logic as training and verification (truncate/pad to 1 second).\n  - Extract Mel-Spectrogram features using the unified `pkg/features.Extract` pipeline.\n- **Output:** \n  - Print the confidence score (0.0 to 1.0).\n  - Print a clear "HOTWORD" or "NOT HOTWORD" verdict based on the `threshold`.\n  - Display file metadata (duration, sample rate).\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- Running `hotword predict --file samples/test.wav` correctly identifies known hotwords from the `data_test` set.\n- The output clearly distinguishes between the verdict and the numerical confidence.\n- The command fails gracefully if the WAV file is invalid or the model cannot be loaded.
