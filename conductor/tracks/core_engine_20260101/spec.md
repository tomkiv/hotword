# Specification: Core Hotword Detection Engine\n\n## Overview\nThis track focuses on the fundamental components of the hotword detection system: transforming raw audio into a format suitable for machine learning (Mel-Spectrograms) and implementing a custom CNN architecture to perform real-time inference.\n\n## Audio Preprocessing\n- **WAV Loader:** Ability to read 16-bit PCM WAV files.\n- **STFT:** Implement Short-Time Fourier Transform to extract frequency information.\n- **Mel-Filterbank:** Apply Mel-scale filters to transform frequency data into human-centric auditory features.\n- **Spectrogram Generation:** Produce a 2D representation (time vs. Mel-frequency) of the audio signal.\n\n## CNN Model Architecture\n- **Input Layer:** Accepts the Mel-Spectrogram grid.\n- **Convolutional Layers:** 2D convolution operations for spatial feature extraction.\n- **Activation:** Implementation of ReLU activation functions.\n- **Pooling:** Max-pooling layers for dimensionality reduction.\n- **Fully Connected Layers:** Dense layers for final classification.\n- **Output:** A single probability value indicating hotword presence.\n\n## Inference Engine\n- **Streaming Window:** Implementation of a sliding window to process live audio in chunks.\n- **Classification Logic:** Logic to trigger the hotword event when the model output exceeds a configurable threshold.
