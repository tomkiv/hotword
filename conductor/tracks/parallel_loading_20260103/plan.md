# Plan: Parallel Data Loading and Progress UX\n\n## Phase 1: Progress UX Utilities [checkpoint: 7fba342]\n- [x] Task: Implement progress bar utility in pkg/train/progress.go (e600890)\n  - [ ] Define `ProgressBar` struct with `Update`, `Finish`, and `Metric` methods\n  - [ ] Implement smooth `\r` line updates for terminal output\n  - [ ] Write unit tests for progress bar math (percentages, ETAs)\n- [x] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Phase 1: Progress UX Utilities' (Protocol in workflow.md) (7fba342)\n\n## Phase 2: Parallel Data Loading\n- [ ] Task: Implement parallel WAV loading in `pkg/train/dataset.go`\n  - [ ] Refactor `LoadDataset` to use goroutines for reading files concurrently\n  - [ ] Integrate the `ProgressBar` into the loading sequence\n  - [ ] Write unit tests to verify dataset integrity when loaded in parallel\n- [ ] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Phase 2: Parallel Data Loading' (Protocol in workflow.md)\n\n## Phase 3: Trainer Integration and Benchmarking\n- [ ] Task: Integrate progress bars into `Trainer` and `ParallelTrainer`\n  - [ ] Update `Train` loops to initialize and update a progress bar per epoch\n  - [ ] Implement epoch timing and performance summary logging\n- [ ] Task: Update `cmd/train.go` UX\n  - [ ] Ensure all log output is compatible with dynamic progress bars (avoiding line collisions)\n  - [ ] Verify time-taken and samples-per-second accuracy\n- [ ] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Phase 3: Trainer Integration and Benchmarking' (Protocol in workflow.md)
