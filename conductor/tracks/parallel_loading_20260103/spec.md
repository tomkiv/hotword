# Specification: Parallel Data Loading and Progress UX\n\n## Overview\nDuring training, data loading is currently slow and lacks visual feedback. This track implements parallelized WAV loading using goroutines and enhances the CLI user experience with dynamic progress indicators and performance metrics.\n\n## Functional Requirements\n- **Parallel Data Loading:** Update the dataset loading logic to use multiple goroutines for crawling directories and reading WAV files into memory.\n- **Loading Progress Indicator:** Display a real-time progress bar and "Files per Second" metric during the initial dataset load.\n- **Training Progress Indicator:** \n  - Show a dynamic progress bar during each training epoch.\n  - Display "Samples per Second" and "Estimated Time Remaining" (ETA).\n- **Epoch Performance Summary:** At the end of each epoch, report the total time taken (e.g., "Epoch 1 complete in 12.4s").\n\n## Implementation Details\n- **Parallel Load:** Use a worker pool or `sync.WaitGroup` in `pkg/train/dataset.go` to parallelize `LoadWAV` calls.\n- **UX Utilities:** Implement a simple `ProgressBar` struct in a new `pkg/ux` or utility package to handle the dynamic `\r` updates.\n- **Timing:** Use `time.Now()` at the start and end of loading and training loops to calculate metrics.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- Dataset loading time is significantly reduced on systems with many WAV files.\n- The `train` command provides constant visual feedback through a progress bar.\n- Epoch summaries accurately reflect the time taken.\n- All CLI output remains clean and doesn't flicker or break line positioning.
