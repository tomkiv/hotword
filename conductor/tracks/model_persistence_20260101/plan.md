# Plan: Model Persistence\n\n## Phase 1: Binary Format Implementation\n- [ ] Task: Define binary schema and implement model writer\n  - [ ] Write tests for model serialization to a buffer\n  - [ ] Implement `SaveModel` logic in `pkg/model`\n- [ ] Task: Implement model reader and validation\n  - [ ] Write tests for loading models from a buffer and handling invalid data\n  - [ ] Implement `LoadModel` logic in `pkg/model`\n- [ ] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Phase 1: Binary Format Implementation' (Protocol in workflow.md)\n\n## Phase 2: Integration and Consistency\n- [ ] Task: Ensure round-trip consistency\n  - [ ] Write tests for Save -> Load -> Result comparison (exact match check)\n  - [ ] Verify loaded model produces identical inference results to the original\n- [ ] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Phase 2: Integration and Consistency' (Protocol in workflow.md)
