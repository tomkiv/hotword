# Plan: 'Listen' Command & Action Triggering\n\n## Phase 1: Subcommand Scaffolding\n- [ ] Task: Create 'listen' command in `cmd/listen.go`\n  - [ ] Implement flag parsing for `--action`, `--script`, and `--threshold`\n  - [ ] Add Cobra/Viper binding for new flags\n- [ ] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Phase 1: Subcommand Scaffolding' (Protocol in workflow.md)\n\n## Phase 2: Integration and Detection Loop\n- [ ] Task: Connect Audio Capture to Engine\n  - [ ] Implement the continuous processing loop in `cmd/listen.go`\n  - [ ] Integrate `pkg/audio/capture` and `pkg/engine.Engine`\n- [ ] Task: Implement Visual Feedback and Counter\n  - [ ] Add "DETECTED" banner and real-time counter updates\n- [ ] Task: Implement Cool-down Logic\n  - [ ] Add logic to skip processing during the cool-down period\n- [ ] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Phase 2: Integration and Detection Loop' (Protocol in workflow.md)\n\n## Phase 3: Action Execution\n- [ ] Task: Implement Shell and Script execution\n  - [ ] Add logic to spawn sub-processes for `--action` and `--script`\n  - [ ] Handle potential execution errors gracefully\n- [ ] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Phase 3: Action Execution' (Protocol in workflow.md)
