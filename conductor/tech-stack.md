# Tech Stack - Hotword Detection in Go\n\n## Core Language & Runtime\n- **Language:** Go (Golang) 1.21+\n- **Rationale:** Leverages modern features like structured logging (`slog`) and generics while maintaining high performance and small binary sizes.\n\n## Machine Learning Engine\n- **Implementation:** Custom Native Go Neural Network Engine.\n- **Rationale:** Aligns with the "strict minimalism" goal by implementing CNN/RNN layers, activation functions, and backpropagation natively in Go using standard slices and the `math` package, avoiding heavy CGO dependencies or external ML frameworks.\n\n## Audio Processing\n- **Audio Capture:** OS-Native Drivers (e.g., ALSA for Linux).\n- **Rationale:** Uses minimal wrappers or direct interaction with OS-level audio APIs to maintain a low dependency footprint and ensure low-latency capture on embedded systems.\n\n## Data Persistence & Models\n- **Model Format:** Custom Binary Format.\n- **Rationale:** Optimized for minimal storage and fast loading on resource-constrained hardware like the Raspberry Pi Zero.\n\n## CLI & Configuration\n- **CLI Framework:** Cobra & Viper.\n- **Rationale:** Provides a professional and extensible CLI interface for managing training, inference, and configuration, while the core library remains dependency-free.\n\n## Build & Deployment\n- **Tooling:** Standard `go build` and `go test`.\n- **Target OS:** Linux (ARM/ARM64 for Raspberry Pi).
